For this final part of this POE we were tasked with creating a means of deleting items of the food menu and and on a different activity a filter where  the user can filter the menu by selecting a course such as starters, mains and desserts. Along with all of task that was asigned to me i had made some changes to the app such as adding a splashscreen and changes color of text to make the app more readable. For my delete feature when the chef adds an item to the menu and maakes a mistake or has a change of mind the chef can just click and hold on the item and the item will then be deleted from the menu. Then comes the filter feature targeted for the user/customer the filter works by selecting the course they want and the menu displays the items linked to that course with a display of the average price of an item in the selected course. In addition to the filter i had added toast messages that will show when users click on items they want to purchase.
